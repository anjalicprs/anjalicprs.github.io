This file is related to the third task of spider web-dev inductions.
In this I have developed a game called ping pong game.
It has two levels in it. The first level is slow and the second level is relatively faster than the first level
Also it has an instruction page in it.
All the images and css and js files are also in this repository.
You can play this game whenever you want as it is very easy to play.
